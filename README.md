Opening a Simulator
------------------

If no ardupilot hardware is available try running the Java simulator which is included in the PX4-Ardupilot source code found [here](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot) after downloading navigate tp the root directory and run the command `make px4_sitl jmavsim`. Wait until you see a drone sitting in the middle of a field and get ready to run this project's code.
